# AI Task Planning Template - Starter Framework

> **About This Template:** This is a systematic framework for planning and executing technical projects with AI assistance. Use this structure to break down complex features, improvements, or fixes into manageable, trackable tasks that AI agents can execute effectively.

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
<!-- Give your task a clear, specific name that describes what you're building or fixing -->
**Title:** [Brief, descriptive title - e.g., "Add User Authentication System" or "Fix Payment Integration Bug"]

### Goal Statement
<!-- Write one paragraph explaining what you want to achieve and why it matters for your project -->
**Goal:** [Clear statement of the end result you want and the business/user value it provides]

---
## 2. Strategic Analysis & Solution Options

### When to Use Strategic Analysis
<!--
AI Agent: Use your judgement to determine when strategic analysis is needed vs direct implementation.
-->

**‚úÖ CONDUCT STRATEGIC ANALYSIS WHEN:**
- For PoC work or where there's no existing codebase
- Multiple viable technical approaches exist
- Trade-offs between different solutions are significant
- User requirements could be met through different UX patterns
- Architectural decisions will impact future development
- Implementation approach affects performance, security, or maintainability significantly
- Change touches multiple systems or has broad impact
- User has expressed uncertainty about the best approach

**‚ùå SKIP STRATEGIC ANALYSIS WHEN:**
- Only one obvious technical solution exists
- It's a straightforward bug fix or minor enhancement
- The implementation pattern is clearly established in the codebase
- Change is small and isolated with minimal impact
- User has already specified the exact approach they want

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:** When in doubt, provide strategic analysis. It's better to over-communicate than to assume.

### Problem Context
<!-- Restate the problem and why it needs strategic consideration -->
[Explain the problem and why multiple solutions should be considered ‚Äî what makes this decision important?]

**Alternative Consideration:**
[If there‚Äôs a close second choice, explain why it wasn‚Äôt selected and under what conditions it might be preferable.]

## Decision Request

**üë§ USER DECISION REQUIRED:**  
Based on this analysis, do you want to proceed with the recommended solution (Option **[X]**), or would you prefer a different approach?

**Questions for you to consider:**
- Does the recommended solution align with your priorities?
- Are there any constraints or preferences I should factor in?
- Do you have a different timeline or complexity preference?

**Next Steps:**  
Once you approve the strategic direction, I'll create the detailed implementation plan in the sections below.

## 3. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
<!--
AI Agent: Analyze the project to fill this out.
- Check `package.json` for versions and dependencies.
- Check `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.
- Check `tailwind.config.ts` for styling and theme.
- Check `drizzle/schema/` for database schema.
- Check `middleware.ts` for authentication and routing.
- Check `components/` for existing UI patterns.
-->

- **Frameworks & Versions:** TODO: List your main frameworks and versions
- **Language:** TODO: Specify your programming language and version
- **Database & ORM:** TODO: Define your database and ORM choice
- **UI & Styling:** TODO: List your UI framework and styling approach
- **Authentication:** TODO: Specify your authentication system

### Current State
<!-- Describe what exists today - what's working, what's broken, what's missing -->
[Analysis of your current codebase state, existing functionality, and what needs to be changed]
